let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// line 3 is reassigning the value of line one. = is not equal sign but a variable creating operator.
// the idea is count is the original count 0 and adding to it 1. So the count is reassigned to 1.
