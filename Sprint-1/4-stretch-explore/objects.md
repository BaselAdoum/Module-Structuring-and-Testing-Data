In this activity, we'll explore some additional concepts that you'll encounter in more depth later on in the course.

Open the Chrome devtools Console, type in `console.log` and then hit enter

What output do you get?

Now enter just `console` in the Console, what output do you get back?

Try also entering `typeof console`

Answer the following questions:

What does `console` store?
What does the syntax `console.log` or `console.assert` mean? In particular, what does the `.` mean?

**ANSWER**
console stores an object that contains methods used for debugging and logging information to the browser’s developer console.

The syntax console.log or console.assert means accessing a property or method of the console object.
those properties (some of them) are shown to the user when clicking the dot (.)
The . (dot) operator is used to access properties or functions that belong to an object. For example, log is a function that belongs to the console object, so it is accessed as console.log.
